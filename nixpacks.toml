# Ensures OS-level dependencies required at runtime are present.

# Prefect deployments in this repo use the `git_clone` pull step.
# The worker needs `git` available at runtime to clone the repo.
# Railway uses Nixpacks; installing via Nix is the most reliable option.
# We also keep `aptPkgs` as a fallback for images that support `apt-get`.
